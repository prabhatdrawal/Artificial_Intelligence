## What is an API?
An API is a set of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other .Think of it as a bridge that connects two systems—such as a client and a server—and enables them to work together seamlessly.

To understand it better, imagine you're at a restaurant: the waiter (API) takes your order (request), gives it to the chef (server), and then brings the prepared food (response) back to your table. Similarly, when you search for a course on a website, your request goes through an API, which then fetches the data from the database and sends it back as a response.

Today, over 80% of modern web applications rely on APIs to fetch data, integrate with third-party services, or enable features like login, payments, or real-time updates. APIs play a crucial role in building flexible, scalable, and connected software systems.

## Why Do We Need APIs?
APIs help developers to create software programs more easily. Instead of writing complex code from scratch, they can call APIs that already provide the functions they need. For example, if a developer wants to display a weather report, they can use an API to get the data instead of creating the entire system to gather weather data themselves.

APIs are also crucial in building modern websites, where heavy data transfers happen between the client (user) and the server.

## How Do APIs Work?

APIs work in a simple step-by-step process:

Request: A client (user) sends a request through the API's URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
Processing: The API forwards the request to the server.
Response: The server processes the request and sends the response back to the API.
Delivery: The API returns the server's response to the client.
Think of this as a client-server architecture: the client sends a request, the server processes it, and the API acts as the messenger.curity threats. To provide additional security layers to the data, HTTP headers, query string parameters, or cookies are used.

## Types of API Architectures:

REST (Representational State Transfer) :A simple, flexible API architecture that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) :A more rigid protocol that requires XML-based messaging for communication.
Both define a standard communication protocol for the exchange of messages in XML (Extensible Markup Language).

## How is an API Different From a Web Application?
An API acts as an interface that allows proper communication between two programs whereas a web application is a network-based resource responsible for completing a single task. Also, it's important to know that "All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web".

The difference between an API and a web application is that API allows two-way communication and web applications are just a way for users to interact through a web browser. A web application may have an API to complete the requests.

# Types of APIs
There are three basic forms of API -

1. WEB APIs
A Web API also called Web Services is an extensively used API over the web and can be easily accessed using the HTTP protocols. A Web application programming interface is an open-source interface and can be used by a large number of clients through their phones, tablets, or PCs.

2. LOCAL APIs
In this type of API, the programmers get the local middleware services. TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface), and .NET are common examples of Local APIs.

3. PROGRAM APIs
It makes a remote program appear to be local by making use of RPCs (Remote Procedural Calls). SOAP is a well-known example of this type of API.

Few other types of APIs:

SOAP (SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL): It defines messages in XML format used by web applications to communicate with each other.

REST (Representational State Transfer): It makes use of HTTP to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE data. It is basically used to take advantage of the existing data.

JSON-RPC: It uses JSON for data transfer and is a lightweight remote procedural call defining a few data structure types.
XML-RPC: It is based on XML and uses HTTP for data transfer. This API is widely used to exchange information between two or more networks.
