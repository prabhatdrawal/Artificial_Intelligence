## What is an API?
An API is a set of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other .Think of it as a bridge that connects two systems—such as a client and a server—and enables them to work together seamlessly.

To understand it better, imagine you're at a restaurant: the waiter (API) takes your order (request), gives it to the chef (server), and then brings the prepared food (response) back to your table. Similarly, when you search for a course on a website, your request goes through an API, which then fetches the data from the database and sends it back as a response.

Today, over 80% of modern web applications rely on APIs to fetch data, integrate with third-party services, or enable features like login, payments, or real-time updates. APIs play a crucial role in building flexible, scalable, and connected software systems.

## Why Do We Need APIs?
APIs help developers to create software programs more easily. Instead of writing complex code from scratch, they can call APIs that already provide the functions they need. For example, if a developer wants to display a weather report, they can use an API to get the data instead of creating the entire system to gather weather data themselves.

APIs are also crucial in building modern websites, where heavy data transfers happen between the client (user) and the server.
