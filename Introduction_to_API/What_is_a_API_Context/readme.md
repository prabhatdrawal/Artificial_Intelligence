## What is an API?
An API is a set of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other .Think of it as a bridge that connects two systems—such as a client and a server—and enables them to work together seamlessly.

To understand it better, imagine you're at a restaurant: the waiter (API) takes your order (request), gives it to the chef (server), and then brings the prepared food (response) back to your table. Similarly, when you search for a course on a website, your request goes through an API, which then fetches the data from the database and sends it back as a response.
